# Vehicle Dealership Management System

## Overview

The Vehicle Dealership Management System is a Java application that allows users to manage a dealership's inventory of vehicles. Users can perform various operations such as adding, removing, and viewing vehicles based on different criteria (e.g., price, make, model, year, color, mileage, and type).
